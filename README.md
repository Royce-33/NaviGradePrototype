# NaviGradePrototype
Repository for our Software Engineering group's project prototype. **In it's current form, only the front-end is implemented due to time constraints.**

## How to Run
The project is built on JavaFX, which is the main dependency. You can find install instructions for JavaFX on their website: https://openjfx.io

Use any IDE, in development we used Visual Studio Code and Eclipse.

You need to change your runtime configuration to the following:
```
--module-path <HIS PATH FOR LIBRARY> --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
```
See the screenshot below for an example in Eclipse:
